        :alt: Documentation Status




A highly opinionated image processor for the commandline. Multiple subcommands can
be executed sequentially to form a processing pipeline.

:code:`imgwrench` is free software available under the MIT license.
Detailed documentation can be found at https://imgwrench.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

* Subcommands can be executed sequentially to form a pipeline
* Command *blackwhite* for converting images to black and white
* Command *collage* creates a collage from multiple images
* Command *colorfix* for fixing the colors of aged photographs
* Command *crop* for cropping images to give aspect ratio
* Command *dither* for converting images to black and white and dithering
* Command *filmstrip* to stack images horizontally forming a filmstrip
* Command *flip* to flip/mirror images left-right
* Command *frame* to put a monocolor frame around images
* Command *framecrop* top frame and crop an image to a target aspect ratio
* Command *quad* collects four images to a quad
* Command *resize* for resizing images
* Command *save* for no processing, but saving images with the given parameters
* Command *stack* for vertically stacking images


Installation
------------

Make sure you have Python and pip installed and available in your $PATH.
Then :code:`imgwrench` can be installed with

.. code-block:: console

        pip install imgwrench


In order to install for the current user only, you may want to execute

.. code-block:: console

        pip install --user imgwrench


instead. In this case you will have to ensure that the local bin directory
(typically :code:`~/.local/bin` on Linux systems) is contained in your $PATH.

Note that legacy Python2 is not supported. If your system still ships Python2
as the default Python interpreter, you may have to execute

.. code-block:: console

        pip3 install imgwrench


or

.. code-block:: console

        python3 -m pip install imgwrench


Usage
-----

:code:`imgwrench` is used on the command line by piping file paths into it, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

        ls /path/to/my/images/*.jpg | imgwrench blackwhite


Full command line help is

.. code-block:: console

        Usage: imgwrench [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...

        A highly opinionated image processor for the commandline. Multiple
        subcommands can be executed sequentially to form a processing pipeline.

        Options:
        -i, --image-list FILENAME  File containing paths to images for processing,
                                defaults to stdin

        -p, --prefix TEXT          prefix for all output filenames before numbering
                                [default: img_]

        -d, --digits INTEGER       number of digits for file numbering  [default: 4]
        -c, --increment INTEGER    increment for file numbering  [default: 1]
        -k, --keep-names           keep original file names instead of numbering
                                [default: False]

        -f, --force-overwrite      force overwriting output image file if it exists
                                [default: False]

        -o, --outdir DIRECTORY     output directory  [default: .]
        -q, --quality INTEGER      quality of the output images, integer 0 - 100
                                [default: 88]

        -e, --preserve-exif        preserve image exif and xmp metadata if available
                                [default: False]

        -j, --jpg / --png          save output images in JPEG format (otherwise PNG)
                                [default: True]

        --help                     Show this message and exit.

        Commands:
        blackwhite  Convert color images to black and white.
        collage     Create a collage from multiple images.
        colorfix    Fix colors by stretching channel histograms to full range.
        crop        Crop images to the given aspect ratio.
        dither      Apply black-white dithering to images.
        filmstrip   Stack all images horizontally, creating a filmstrip.
        flip        Flip/mirror images left-right.
        frame       Put a monocolor frame around images.
        framecrop   Crop and frame an image to a target aspect ratio.
        quad        Collects four images to a quad.
        resize      Resize images to a maximum side length preserving aspect...
        save        No-op to enable saving of images without any processing.
        stack       Stacks pairs of images vertically, empty space in the middle.


Pipelines
---------

:code:`imgwrench` subcommands can be combined into pipelines. This saves you from generating intermediate
files cluttering your filesystem or reducing the quality of the final results. For example, if you
want to convert all images in the current directory to black and white, put a white frame
around them and have them cut to an aspect ratio of 3:2 (for standard format printing), you would
execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

        ls *.JPG | \
        imgwrench -o out -q 95 -p oldschool_img_ \
                blackwhite \
                framecrop -a 3:2 -w 0.03 -c white

Please refer to the `detailed subcommand documentation`_ for the individual parameters.

Developer Notes
---------------

Should you run into the following exception while running :code:`imgwrench` from an editable install

.. code-block:: console

        importlib_metadata.PackageNotFoundError: No package metadata was found for imgwrench

try executing :code:`make dist` to regenerate the :code:`egg` files required bei :code:`importlib`
which have likely been removed by a call to :code:`make clean`.
